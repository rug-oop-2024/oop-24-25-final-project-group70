# DSC-0002: Implement `Artifact` Class for Machine Learning Artifact Management
# Date: 2024-11-08
# Decision: Create `Artifact` class to represent machine learning artifacts with metadata, versioning, and serialization capabilities
# Status: Accepted
# Motivation: To standardize the management and tracking of machine learning artifacts like models, datasets, and pipeline outputs
# Reason: Centralized artifact representation enables easier version control, metadata storage, and serialization, enhancing reproducibility in machine learning workflows
# Limitations: Currently supports basic artifact types with binary data, assumes `data` is always binary, and limited to `numerical` and `categorical` feature types
# Alternatives: Extend artifact representation to include additional data formats and dynamic metadata handling; incorporate data validation rules for different artifact types
